# Fountain Support for Atom
This package aims to provide syntax highlighting and utilities to improve the experience of screenwriting with the [Fountain](http://fountain.io/) syntax.

## Features:
* Outline list navigator (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> <kbd>alt</kbd> <kbd>o</kbd>)
* Formatted preview (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> <kbd>alt</kbd> <kbd>shift</kbd> <kbd>m</kbd>)
* Symbol listing via the [symbols-view package](https://github.com/atom/symbols-view) (<kbd>crtl</kbd> <kbd>r</kbd>)

## Development
This is currently a work in progress, pulling from a few different tools:

* HTML preview support from [Fountain.js](https://github.com/mattdaly/Fountain.js)
* Syntax highlighting based on [The Candler Blog](http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/09/10/fountain-for-sublime-text/)

Please open issues with feature requests that would improve your work flow.
